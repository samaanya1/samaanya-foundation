            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              Hearing loss means the ear isn't able to detect or process sound the way it
              typically would. It can be present from birth or develop over time. It can be
              mild, profound, or anywhere in between — and it can affect one or both ears.
              Hearing loss is not an illness. It is a difference, and there is a great deal
              that can be done to support a person who lives with it.

            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              When a child is diagnosed, parents often feel overwhelmed — by medical terms,
              by decisions, by the worry of what the future holds. These feelings are
              normal. You are not alone in them, and you don't need to have all the answers
              right away.

              <li className="flex gap-3"><span className="mt-2 h-1.5 w-1.5 shrink-0 rounded-full bg-accent" /> Confusion about which professional to see first</li>
              <li className="flex gap-3"><span className="mt-2 h-1.5 w-1.5 shrink-0 rounded-full bg-accent" /> Pressure to decide between hearing aids, implants, sign language, or a mix</li>

            <h2 className="mt-5 font-serif text-3xl md:text-4xl">Why early support matters</h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              The earlier a family receives accurate information and support, the more
              options they have. Early identification, consistent listening practice, and a
              supportive environment can make a meaningful difference in a child's
              communication, education, and confidence.
