    bio: "Aanya Tulsyan is the co founder of a foundation supporting students with cochlear implants and individuals navigating hearing loss. Her connection to this work is deeply personal, shaped by her brother, Samay Pravin Tulsyan, whose journey with a cochlear implant gave her an early understanding of the barriers that often go unnoticed. Growing up alongside him, she saw how classrooms and social spaces are not always designed with accessibility in mind. Those experiences continue to influence how she thinks about inclusion as something that must be intentionally built into everyday systems. She is currently a student at Ashoka University, where her academic environment has strengthened her commitment to creating more equitable and responsive spaces. Through the foundation, she focuses on awareness, guidance, and building a support system for students and families. The goal is to make information more accessible, reduce uncertainty, and ensure that students can move through their academic journeys with confidence and independence.",

            <p>
              I am <span className="font-serif text-2xl text-primary">Samay Tulsyan</span>, and I
              have lived with hearing disability for most of my life. While medical support and
              technology helped me hear better, they could not erase the challenges that came
              with being different in a society that often fails to understand disability with
              empathy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Growing up, I faced rejection, exclusion, and constant judgment. I was denied
              opportunities, struggled to find acceptance in schools, and often had to work
              twice as hard just to be treated equally. There were moments when people saw my
              hearing disability before they saw me as a person. The emotional impact of
              feeling isolated, misunderstood, or left behind is something countless individuals
              with hearing disabilities silently go through every day.
            </p>
            <p className="font-serif text-2xl text-accent">
              But these experiences also shaped my purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Samaanya Foundation was created with the belief that people with hearing
              disabilities deserve more than medical assistance — they deserve dignity,
              inclusion, confidence, and equal opportunities. Our work is not limited to
              providing support; it is about standing beside individuals and families as they
              navigate education, social acceptance, emotional well-being, and access to
              opportunities that many take for granted.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that disability should never become a barrier to education,
              friendships, careers, or dreams. Through awareness, guidance, financial support,
              and community building, Samaanya Foundation aims to create a society where people
              with hearing disabilities are not made to feel different, but are empowered to
              live with confidence and pride.
            </p>
            <p className="font-serif text-2xl text-primary">
              Because true inclusion begins when society learns to listen beyond a disability.
